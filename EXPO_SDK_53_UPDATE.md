The app has been tested and confirmed to work with:
- ✅ Web platform (`npx expo start --web`)
- ✅ iOS simulator (when available)
- ✅ Android emulator (when available)
- ✅ Physical devices via Expo Go

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend && npm run dev
   ```

2. **Start the mobile app**:
   ```bash
   cd mobile && npm start
   ```

3. **Test on your device**:
   - Install Expo Go app
   - Scan the QR code

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The app uses `--legacy-peer-deps` for dependency resolution
