## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB (local or cloud)
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- React Native development environment

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:
   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/helloworld
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
   NODE_ENV=development
   ```

4. Start MongoDB (if running locally)

5. Seed the database with sample data:
   ```bash
   npm run seed
   ```

6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The backend will be running on `http://localhost:3000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the mobile directory:
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Expo development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Use the Expo Go app on your phone to scan the QR code, or run on an emulator:
   - iOS: `npm run ios`
   - Android: `npm run android`
